Hello,

Welcome to HANA cats, a simple app to showcase using the hana-client library
against a HANA Cloud instance. This app is ment to showcase how to use prepared
statements from node to execute SQL functions in HANA, by exposing RESTful 
enpoints. To get started with this app there are somethings you will need to do.

1.) Create a HANA Cloud instance, remember your DBADMIN password or create another 
    service user
2.) Create a schema called TEST_SCHEMA
3.) in the SQL console type SET SCHEMA TEST_SCHEMA;
4.) In TEST_SCHEMA create a table called cats use this code:
    CREATE TABLE "CATS" (
        "CAT_ID" INT NOT NULL primary key GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY, 
        "NAME" NVARCHAR(55) NOT NULL DEFAULT 'NoName',
        "AGE" INT
    );
5.) Test by manually adding some cats in the SQL console
6.) Clone this project from my github repo
7.) open a new terminal and run 'npm install'
8.) run npm install -g nodemon
9.)create a .env file in the root folder of your project
10.)Include these values:
    1.)DBSRC <- this is holds the HANA cloud connection string its <host:port>
    2.)DBUSR <- The user you created or DBADMIN
    3.)DBPASS <- The password you created
    4.)PORT <- I set this to 4002 usually BAS seems to like this
    Dont know how to make a .env file read this blog: https://medium.com/@thejasonfile/using-dotenv-package-to-create-environment-variables-33da4ac4ea8f
11.) Run npm start and test locally
12.) run cf login and log in with your credentials 
13.) Run cf push --random-route
14.) Wait 
15.) Wait some more 
16.) Open your app in your dev space 

If you are not familar with rest this is a simple example 
GET /cats <- returns all the cats
POST /cats <- adds a new cats
DELETE /cats/:id <- deletes a cats
PATCH /cats/:id <- updates an existing cat
