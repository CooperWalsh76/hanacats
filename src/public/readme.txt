Welcome to the public folder, here I have the site images, site css and client-side 
javascript.  If you are using some jank-ass version of internet explorer, first off
why it is 2021 dog move on, second this app will not work because I use the js native
fetch() function.  Why do I use fetch() and not XHR() or AJAX(), because I am not a 
company that has to support legacy systems.  XHR is dead, AJAX has sucked for years 
and Internet Explorer was always the worst browser.  Do things in an async fashion, 
why because the code is cleaner and its easier to work with.  If you send me an email 
that says "this app doesnt work" and I find out you are using internet explorer I will
publicly shame you on linkedIn.  Move on to a better browser, the rest of the world
has
