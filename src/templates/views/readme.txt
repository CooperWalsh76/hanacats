Hello,
This is all the views for the HANA cats app, here I use the handlebars framework,
 a simple templating engine that works well with express, I don't use any of the handlebars 
 plugin calls but in theory you could add them.  What is mainly contained here is the html
 that gets render on the page.  I use both the bootstrap CSS CDN and the JQuery CDS to help
 lean out this project.  For refrence to either please look at:

 Bootstrap: https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.4/css/
 Jquery: https://jquery.com/
